# Getting Started

Kraken API is designed to extend the RuneLite API with additional client interaction utilities for writing RuneLite plugins with extended functionality.
This API is not meant for "botting", reverse engineering, automation or rule-breaking purposes, and any material provided by this API or its documentation is purely for 
educational purposes only.

Use at your own risk. The developers are not responsible for any consequences resulting from the use of this software.

## Quick Start

To get started with the API instantly:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Kraken-Plugins/kraken-api
cd ./kraken-api

./gradlew build publishToMavenLocal
```

In the repository containing all your plugins `build.gradle` file: 

```groovy

repositories {
    // Attempts local first for testing API jar
    mavenLocal {
        content {
            includeGroup "com.github.kraken"
        }
    }
  
  // .. other repositories like RuneLite.net, etc...
}

dependencies {
  compileOnly group: 'com.github.kraken', name:'kraken-api', version: '5.0.0' // or the version you built with VERSION=...
}
```

## API Usage

The following RuneLite "plugin" is purely for an example of the API's capabilities:

```java
@PluginDescriptor(
        name = "Example",
        description = "Example plugin"
)
public class ExamplePlugin extends Plugin {
    
    @Inject
    private Context ctx;
    
    @Inject
    private BankService bank;
    
    @Inject
    private MovementService movement;
    
    @Inject
    private PrayerService prayer;
    
    @Subscribe
    private void onGameTick(GameTick e) {
      Player local = ctx.players().local().raw();
      
      if(local.isInteracting()) {
          return;
      }
      
      if(!bank.isOpen()) {
          // Open a bank
          ctx.gameObjects().withName("Bank booth").sortByDistance().interact("Open");
      } else {
          // Withdraw a Rune Scimitar
          ctx.bank().nameContains("Rune scimitar").first().ifPresent(item -> item.withdraw(1));
      }
      
      // Wield the Rune Scimitar from the inventory
      ctx.inventory().withId(1333).interact("Wield");
      
      // Move to a new position
      movement.moveTo(new WorldPoint(3253, 3420, 0));
      
      // Activate a protection prayer
      prayer.activatePrayer(Prayer.PROTECT_FROM_MELEE);
      
      // "Click" on a Goblin and attack it.
      ctx.npcs().withName("Goblin")
            .except(n -> n.raw().isInteracting())
            .sortByDistance()
            .interact("Attack");
      
      
      // Take the goblin bones
      ctx.groundItems().withName("Bones")
              .reachable()
              .within(5)
              .nearest()
              .ifPresent(GroundObjectEntity::take);
      
      // Bury the bones
      ctx.inventory().withName("Bones").interact("Bury");
    }
}
```

To use the API in an actual RuneLite plugin, you should check out the [Kraken Example Plugins](https://github.com/cbartram/kraken-example-plugin)
which shows the best practice usage of the API within an actual plugin.
To set up your development environment for running plugins, we recommend following [this guide on RuneLite's Wiki](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Building-with-IntelliJ-IDEA).

Once you have the example plugin cloned and setup within Intellij, you can run the main class in `src/test/java/PluginRunnerTest.java plugins.api.ApiTestPlugin` to run RuneLite with
the example plugin loaded in the plugin panel within RuneLite's sidebar. See a recommended [Gradle example](#gradle-example-recommended) for more information on
integrating the API into your plugins and build process.

![example-plugin](./images/example-plugin-2.png)

> If you are just looking to use pre-existing plugins, you can skip this repository and head over to our website: [kraken-plugins.com](https://kraken-plugins.com). 
> For more documentation on the API and Kraken plugins, please see our [official documentation here](https://kraken-plugins.com/docs/).

### Prerequisites
- [Java 11+](https://adoptium.net/) (JDK required)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) (wrapper included, no need to install globally)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [RuneLite](https://runelite.net) (for testing and running plugins)

### Building

You can build the project with Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal shadowJar

# Optionally you can set a specific version to build
export VERSION=5.0.0-SNAPSHOT-LOCAL
./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal shadowJar

# Will be found here:
# ~/.m2/repository/com/github/kraken/kraken-api/5.0.0-SNAPSHOT-LOCAL/kraken-api-5.0.0-SNAPSHOT-LOCAL.jar
```

The output API `.jar` can be found in your `~/.m2/repository/com/github/kraken/kraken-api` directory and the default version is `1.0.0`.
Include the JAR file in your local plugins project with:

```groovy
repositories {
  mavenLocal() // Ensure this is included to pull from the locally built API JAR
  mavenCentral()
  maven {
    url = 'https://repo.runelite.net'
  }
}

dependencies {
    implementation group: 'com.github.kraken', name: 'kraken-api', version: '1.0.0' // or whichever version you built with when export VERSION=...
}
```

This also builds the shaded jar that is published and loaded by the Kraken client. It bundles the `shortest-path` pathfinding library and its data;
RuneLite, Guice, Guava, Gson, SLF4J and Lombok are `compileOnly` and provided by RuneLite at runtime. It is located in:

```shell
build/libs/kraken-api-<version>.jar
```

## Gradle Example

To use the published API jar file in your plugin project, you will need to either:
- `export GITHUB_ACTOR=<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>; export GITHUB_TOKEN=<GITHUB_PAT`
- or add the following to your `gradle.properties` file: `gpr.user=your-github-username gpr.key=your-personal-access-token`

More information on generating a GitHub Personal Access token can [be found below](#authentication).

###  Authentication

Since the API packages are hosted on [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages) you will
need to generate a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens?versionId=free-pro-team%40latest&productId=packages&restPage=learn-github-packages%2Cintroduction-to-github-packages) on GitHub
to authenticate and pull down the API.

You can generate a GitHub PAT by navigating to your [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens)
and clicking "Generate new Token." Give the token a unique name and optional description with read-only access to public repositories. Store the token
in a safe place as it won't be viewable again. It can be used to authenticate to GitHub and pull Kraken API packages.

> :warning: Do **NOT** share this token with anyone.

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'application'
}


// Replace with the package version of the API you need
def krakenApiVersion = 'X.Y.Z'

// Alternatively, you can use: `+` or `2.2.+` (for example) as the krakenApiVersion to float on the latest version within a safe boundary
// so you don't have to constantly bump the version when new API changes are released!

allprojects {
    apply plugin: 'java'
    repositories {
        // You must declare this maven repository to be able to search and pull Kraken API packages
        maven {
            name = "GitHubPackages"
            url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/Kraken-Plugins/kraken-api")
            credentials {
                username = project.findProperty("gpr.user") ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_ACTOR")
                password = project.findProperty("gpr.key") ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
            }
        }

        // Jitpack is an alternative means of accessing the API Jar file
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}


dependencies {
    compileOnly group: 'com.github.kraken', name:'kraken-api', version: krakenApiVersion
    // ... other dependencies
}
```

## API Design & Methodology

For more information around how the API is designed, please see [API docs](docs/API.md)

## Scripting

For more information on writing scripts using the Kraken API,  
check out the detailed [scripting guide](docs/SCRIPTING.md).

## Mouse Movement

For more information on mouse movement in the API check out the
detailed [mouse movement guide](docs/MOUSE.md)

## Utilities

The Kraken API also ships with a variety of useful utilities for plugins from logging, mouse, and table overlays to
custom RuneLite events, randomization, math and string methods! To learn more about
Kraken's extra utilities, check out [this doc](docs/UTILITIES.md).

## Simulation

For information on how to use Kraken's API to simulate game outcomes,  
see the [simulation docs](docs/SIMULATION.md).

To see an example plugin using the simulation API, you can run the main class in:

```
src/test/java/PluginRunnerTest.java plugins.simulation.SimulationPlugin
```

to load an example simulation plugin alongside RuneLite.

![sim-example-image](images/sim.png)


### Colosseum Simulator 

There is a separate port of the [Colosseum Line of Sight Simulation](https://los.colosim.com/) to Java contained in the repository's test sources for reference
that can be run in its own GUI from the `colosim` package under `src/test/java`. It is not part of the published jar.

![colosseum-sim](./images/colosim.png)

## Game Updates

Please see the game updates and [how to update the API guide](docs/UPDATING.md) for more detailed information.

After each RuneLite update, run `python3 scripts/check_hooks.py` (needs only Python 3). It downloads the injected client for `runeLiteVersion` in `build.gradle` and prints a PASS/FAIL table for every class, field and method in `hooks.json`. It exits non-zero on any stale hook. Use `--runelite <version>`, `--jar <file>` or `--hooks <file>` to check other combinations. It checks structure only; multipliers and garbage values still have to be confirmed against the manual-mapping guide and at runtime.

## Running Tests

Please see the [testing guide](docs/TESTS.md) for more information on running tests.

## Development Workflow

Clone this repository with: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Kraken-Plugins/kraken-api.git` to ensure
that all submodules (shortest-path plugin) are cloned as well.

1. Create a new branch from `master`
2. Implement or update your plugin/feature for the API
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Run `./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal shadowJar` to verify that the API builds and tests pass
5. Commit your changes with a clear message `git commit -m "feat(api): Add feature X to Kraken API"`
6. Open a Pull Request

---

## Deployment

The Kraken API is automatically built and deployed via GitHub actions on every push to the `master` branch.
The latest version can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/Kraken-Plugins/kraken-api/releases) section of the repository.

The deployment is fully automated and consists of:

-  Building the API JAR
- Publishing a new version to the GitHub Releases section
  - This will be picked up by Github Packages for easy integration into other gradle projects.
- Uploading the JAR file to the SeaweedFS storage server used by the Kraken Client at runtime.

## 🔖 Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
See the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/Kraken-Plugins/kraken-api/tags) for available releases.

CI will automatically bump the patch version on each merge to master i.e. `1.1.4` -> `1.1.5`. If you want to bump 
a minor or major version then update the `version.txt` file in the root of the repository with the new version you
want to use as a base.

For example, moving from: `1.3.5` -> `1.4.0` the `version.txt` should be `1.4.0`. The next automatic build will use `1.4.1` then `1.4.2` etc...
until `version.txt` is updated to `1.5.0` or `2.0.0`.
